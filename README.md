Repo 2 of a collection of repos including my misadventures into deep learning, ML, and AI as a 15 year old.

This one's an absolute mess because I wanted to conserve memory and hence stuffed everything that used the tensorflow and keras libraries into one folder, since pycharm created massive folders everytime
i started a new project

This one contains my experiments with LSTMS, GANS, image processing, NLP (i think), and even a bit of (highly uninformed) stock trading. Venture further at your own risk.
